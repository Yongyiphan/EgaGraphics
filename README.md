# C++ Project Starter Template

This is a little quick-start project template for C++ projects which utilise a Core/App project architecture. 
[Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.

Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple applications.

The `Scripts/` directory contains build scripts for Windows and Linux, and the `Vendor/` directory contains Premake binaries (currently version `5.0-beta2`).
